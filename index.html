                            About Kelly Akhigbe

I am Kelly Akhigbe, proudly from Edo State, Nigeria — where my passion for education began. Growing up in a family that deeply valued learning, I was taught that knowledge is both a gift and a responsibility to share.

My journey started humbly as a home lesson tutor, working with students one-on-one and witnessing the joy that comes from understanding something new. That passion quickly grew, leading me into classroom management and, over the years, into key leadership roles including Examination Officer, Cambridge Coordinator, Director of Academics, and currently, Head of School.

Each stage of my career has shaped my perspective, strengthened my expertise, and deepened my belief in the transformative power of education. To me, education is not only about academic success — it’s about shaping character, unlocking potential, and creating opportunities that change lives.

Through K and J Education Consult, my mission is clear: to guide, inspire, and empower individuals to thrive and become the best versions of themselves. Every success story I help shape is a powerful reminder that the work we do in education has a lasting impact on people, families, and communities.
